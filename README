# AgaveClientTester
Simple Command Line Program for testing Agave Client Interface (Use as a guide for programs using Agave Client Interface)

This package requires the AgaveClientProgram, also distributed by NHERI-SimCenter

In order to avoid the problems with sub modules and sub trees, this uses neither. Rather, git clone the AgaveClientInterface in a folder right next to the AgaveClientTester (.ie, a super-folder will contain the folders AgaveClientInterface and AgaveClientTester.)
